Having a friend with a fairly advanced set-up already has helped immensely but I wanted to be sure to capture my journey for those that are also interested (or for me in case I accidentally destroy all my hard work and need to start again).</p>\n<p>My goal was to have a highly configurable set-up without lock in to a particular brand like the Samsung Smart Things or Philips Hue products. Mostly because I wanted to be able to add any sensors or devices from any manufacturer, supporting a wide range of protocols. But also I wanted to limit the amount of information going back and forth to the internet / cloud. Also I wanted to keep costs down even if that meant more work for me in both configuration and using generic, low-cost devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.).</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/\">Hass.io</a> which is a build of <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a> running on a Raspberry Pi. The documentation is great and installation very straightforward. There's a great community behind the project and a whole bunch of add-ons that make integrations and automations quite straight forward.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>Essentially the steps are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grab an image for your Rasp Pi (or other). In my case it was the 32bit on for the Pi 4.</li>\n<li>Flash it to an SD card (I used balenaEtcher on PC as it's awesome for this, works straight from the zip file).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you can access your running installation (either at <a href=\"http://hassio.local:8123\">http://hassio.local:8123</a> or <a href=\"http://%7BIPAddress%7D:8123\">http://{IPAddress}:8123</a>) then you should do your set up and then enable Multi-factor Authentication (especially if you're going to be exposing it to the internet).</p>\n<p>There are steps in the guide detailing how to set up the WiFi or static IP however I just plugged it in to my network and then found the IP it was given by DHCP then connected to it. I did set a static IP but I used the nmcli tool instead following <a href=\"https://tech.borpin.co.uk/2018/10/18/using-nmcli-to-set-a-static-ipv4-address-in-hass-io/\">this post</a>.</p>\n<p>You will likely need the network manager package in the SSH add-on. Go to the add on in hass.io and add this to the configuration...</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&quot;packages&quot;: [\n    &quot;networkmanager&quot;\n  ],</code></pre></div>\n<p>The command to exit is actually \"quit\" and also there may not actually be a default file in the /etc/NetworkManager/... section as mentioned in the guide.</p>\n<h2>Multi-factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>Go to the bottom left, your account and then click ENABLE on Multi-factor Authentication Modules.</p>\n<p>Use your authenticator app of choice to complete the process.</p>\n<h2>Add-ons</h2>\n<p>Once you're up and running there are several very useful add-ons to set-up. I'll cover them in separate posts but the main ones are...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/samba/\">Samba add-on</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/ssh/\">SSH add-on</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 17, 2020","path":"/home-automation-with-hassio/","title":"Home Automation with HASS.IO"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
